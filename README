The checkpoint of the best model out of the models we trained - Progressive GAN with Wasserstein loss and gradient penalty at resolution 64 X 64, 
the train and test set images and the embeddings(flowers) are available as zipped files in the following drive link :
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/139zKu5AQ3d5DHrL8g6eJ76qFFk8JhFuz?usp=sharing

Download and unzip them in the working directory. 

Training :
Run the training by running python main.py. r_fl parameter in the code represents the directory to read the checpoint from and fl paramater 
represents the checkpoint that we are creating. Checkpoints correspond to epochs of training. 
Model checkpoints get created under model_flowers_0.

Testing :
Create a directory generated_images for storing generated images. 
Run bash generate_all.sh to generate images for all 10 captions corresponding to each test image. If you want multiple images generated
for the same caption, you can change the third parameter to the corresponding caption index instead of -1. Also you can change 
FILES variable with wildcard characters to generate for a subset of test images.
Currently the script generates by taking checkpoint 5 which is the model provided in the drive link.
